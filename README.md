# hello-world
This is my first repository for the sake of learning how to use GitHub. Woo?

# Bio
I guess this is where I talk about myself isn't it. Well there's not much to say at the moment. I'm aspiring to be a web developer and at the time I wrote this I started the #100DaysOfCode challenge so there's that. Anything else is kind of useless history.
